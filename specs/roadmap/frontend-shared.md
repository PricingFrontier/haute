# Frontend shared roadmap

## Scope

The browser's shared hooks, stores, helpers and API client. Current
behaviour is specified in
[the frontend-shared specification](../frontend-shared/high-level.md).
Generating the API contract is planned in the
[server API roadmap](server-api.md) (`API-R03`). These packages come from the
[23 September 2026 codebase review](codebase-review-2026-09-23.md).

## Priorities

| Package | State | Priority | Outcome |
|---|---|---:|---|
| FSH-R03 | Planned | P3 | The results store holds results; validation and optimiser logic move out. |

## Planned improvements

### FSH-R03 — The results store holds results
**Why:** `useNodeResultsStore.ts` combines the store with four recency
caches, module-level derived-preview caches and optimiser logic that
applies the server's frontier-point summaries and converts select
responses into them.

**Plan:** Move the remaining validation to the generated parsers
(`API-R03`), the optimiser logic into an optimiser module and the derived
caches into selectors, leaving the store with state and actions.

**Acceptance:** The store module contains no response validation or domain
derivation; its tests cover state transitions only.

**Dependencies:** `API-R03` (server API).

**Evidence:** `frontend/src/stores/useNodeResultsStore.ts::applyFrontierPointSummary`;
`frontend/src/stores/useNodeResultsStore.ts::hashConfig`.
