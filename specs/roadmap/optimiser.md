# Optimiser roadmap

## Scope

Optimiser configuration, numerical solve/frontier behaviour, artifacts,
ratebooks, performance, interruptibility, and workflows remain reliable.
Current behaviour is specified in [the optimiser specification](../optimiser/low-level.md).

## Priorities

| Package | State | Priority | Outcome |
|---|---|---:|---|
| OPT-P12 | Planned | P2 | Extract the frontier domain service after the scaling decision. |
| OPT-P14 | Planned | P2 | Complete solver/result publication extraction. |

## Planned improvements

The setup steps are free functions in `_optimiser_input.py` that raise typed
failures (`OptimiserSetupError`); the service records them. The frontier sweep
stays serial (the `OPT-P06` measurement). Delivery order is `OPT-P12` →
`OPT-P14`; later packages must not bypass those isolation boundaries. No optimiser path reads pipeline
rows in the server process: the input estimate runs on the warm interactive
worker pool and auto-range sizes its chunks in its worker.

### OPT-P12 — Extract frontier domain service
**Why:** Frontier range normalisation, compute dispatch, payload limiting, job lifecycle, point
selection, and point-artifact retention form a cohesive domain separate from initial solve setup.

**Plan:** Move pure range/point helpers first, then introduce an `OptimiserFrontierService` that
owns explicit sweep admission, cancellation, parent publication, and point-artifact retention.
Replace the current process-global `_frontier_state_lock` with per-parent-job locking, or pin
artifact handles while reads occur so slow parquet reads/deletions can safely move outside the
state lock. Keep FastAPI response assembly in `src/haute/routes/optimiser.py`.

**Acceptance:** Timeout/cancel, single-flight, compute-budget, point-selection, ratebook
materialisation, artifact-cap, and unrelated-parent concurrency regressions remain green at each
extraction step.

**Dependencies:** The current frontier apply and interruptibility contracts; the
sweep stays serial.

**Evidence:** `src/haute/routes/optimiser.py`; `src/haute/routes/_optimiser_service.py`;
`tests/test_optimiser_frontier_materialisation.py`; `tests/test_optimiser_routes.py`.

### OPT-P14 — Extract solver execution and result publication
**Why:** Online/ratebook construction, `SolveContext`, result normalisation, inline frontier
policy, factor-table serialisation, and terminal publication are the final cohesive solver layer.

**Plan:** Move solver-context entry points and result builders to
`src/haute/routes/_optimiser_solver.py`; leave `OptimiserSolveService` as job admission plus
setup/worker composition. Retain the worker-context guard at the extracted public boundary.

**Acceptance:** Online/ratebook solve, cancellation, inline-frontier, golden response, factor
dtype, and save/apply agreement suites pass; `_optimiser_service.py` is an orchestration module
rather than a mixed domain/utilities module.

**Dependencies:** OPT-P12.

**Evidence:** `src/haute/routes/_optimiser_service.py`; `tests/test_optimiser_routes.py`;
`tests/test_optimiser_golden.py`; `tests/test_optimiser_ratebook_apply_agreement.py`.
